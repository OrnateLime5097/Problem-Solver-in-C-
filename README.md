# Problem-Solver-in-C-
This is  a project where I am learning how to program. 
The program takes in inputs
makes those inputs floating piont numbers
does math with those numbers
spits out a response
asks if you want to continue
if not it closes
if yes then it continues

Problems:
-if you input you x or your t as letters the program breaks.
